/*
* Version 2.0 30 may 2025
*
* The Micro-Kernel and Scheduler are constructed for resource constraint
* environments (eg microcontrollers with kilobyte(s) of flash/ram)
*
* The K-RT Kernel provides:
*   - a Scheduler for RT (Real Time) tasks operating at a fixed period of 4ms
*   - a Scheduler for ST (Scheduled Time) tasks operaing on average at the
*     specified period.
*
* The real time code provides guarantee that the code runs exactly at the
* typical 4ms / 20ms / 100ms / 1s period, +/- the execution time.
*
* Real time task can be monitored by Watchdog with a period as low as 17ms
* (default for PIC16F886).
*
* ST (scheduled tasks) are run by the RT (real time) scheduler, and executed
* outside of interrupt context.
* RT (real time tasks) are run in interrupt context (Timer1) with a base cycle
* of 4ms.
*
* Constraints
*
* All RT tasks have to run within the 4ms period, ie., 4-20-100ms and 1s RT
* tasks will eventually run together within a 4ms period, ie 10k instructions
* at most are allowed. Any code that does not need RT context can be exported
* into ST tasks.
*
* RT supervision
*
* RT task Load is supervised by systat() and provides User with information on
* current load (min, max, avg) of tasks running in RT context.
*
* The present code enables the WDT (watchdog timer) with a 17ms period, which
* is cleared in the 4ms RT task.
*
* ST buffer overload
*
* If the ST buffer is full, next scheduling with result in a NOP and the task
* execution will not be booked in the ST scheduler and lost.
*
* If the tasks scheduled in ST scheduler are not critical, it is not harfmul
* to K-RT that either the scheduler is called with an empty task or called
* while the scheduler task list is already full, and therefore simply discarding
* the request.
